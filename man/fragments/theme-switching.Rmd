#### Choose Your Preferred Themes

First, set a default light and dark theme. For your current R sessions, you can use the **Set Default Light Theme to Current** addin (or the corresponding dark theme addin), or you can call the `set_theme_light()` or `set_theme_dark()` functions:

``` r
# Set current theme to default light or dark theme
rsthemes::set_theme_light()
rsthemes::set_theme_dark()

# Set a specific theme to default light or dark theme
rsthemes::set_theme_light("One Light {rsthemes}")
rsthemes::set_theme_dark("One Dark {rsthemes}")
```

To create a list of your **favorite** themes, you can use `set_theme_favorite()`.

```r
# Add current theme to your list of favorites
rsthemes::set_theme_favorite()

# Add a list of themes to your favorites
rsthemes::set_theme_favorite(
  c("GitHub {rsthemes}", "One Light {rsthemes}", "One Dark {rsthemes}")
)
```

These functions only save your preferences for the _current_ R session. To set these defaults for all R sessions, add your preferences to your `~/.Rprofile`. (You can use `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to quickly open your `~/.Rprofile` for editing.)

```r
# ~/.Rprofile
if (interactive()) {
  rsthemes::set_theme_light("GitHub {rsthemes}")
  rsthemes::set_theme_dark("Fairyfloss {rsthemes}")
  rsthemes::set_theme_favorite(
    c("GitHub {rsthemes}", 
      "One Light {rsthemes}", 
      "One Dark {rsthemes}")
  )
}
```

You can also set the following global options directly.

```r
# ~/.Rprofile
options(
  rsthemes.theme_light = "Nord Snow Storm {rsthemes}",
  rsthemes.theme_dark = "Nord Polar Night Aurora {rsthemes}",
  rsthemes.theme_favorite = paste("One", c("Light", "Dark"), "{rsthemes}")
)
```

### Toggle Your Favorite Themes

Use the **Next Favorite Theme** addin to walk through your list of favorite themes. Use the _Modify Keyboard Shortcuts..._ dialog in the _Tools_ menu of RStudio to create a keyboard shortcut to make it easy to quickly switch themes — I use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+ <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>. You can also manually call `use_theme_favorite()` to use the next theme in the your favorites list.

Each time you run the addin, RStudio switches to the next theme in your favorites list. This is great if you have a few themes that you use in various contexts. For example, I have my personal favorite themes plus a few themes that work well during class or presentation sessions.


### Automatic or Manual Light/Dark Mode

Use the **Toggle Dark Mode** addin to switch between your default light and dark themes. You can even set a keyboard shortcut in RStudio — I used <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> — to toggle dark mode.

You can also automatically choose the dark or light theme by time of day, using the included **Auto Choose Dark or Light Theme** addin, which requires that you've set your preferred light/dark themes (see above).

If you would like to automatically choose the dark or light theme by time of day during each new session, you can call `rsthemes::use_theme_auto()` in your `~/.Rprofile`. For best results, use the following template in your `~/.Rprofile` to declare your preferred dark and light themes and to choose the correct style when your R session reloads.

```r
if (interactive() && requireNamespace("rsthemes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # Set preferred themes if not handled elsewhere..
  rsthemes::set_theme_light("One Light {rsthemes}")  # light theme
  rsthemes::set_theme_dark("One Dark {rsthemes}") # dark theme

  # Whenever the R session restarts inside RStudio...
  setHook("rstudio.sessionInit", function(isNewSession) {
    # Automatically choose the correct theme based on time of day
    rsthemes::use_theme_auto(dark_start = "18:00", dark_end = "6:00")
  }, action = "append")
}
```

### Go Back to the Default

Sometimes when you're teaching or demonstrating RStudio features, you'd like to have your IDE match the appearance of your learners, or at least the basic theme that everyone starts out with when they install RStudio for the first time.

Use the **Use Default RStudio Theme** to quickly switch back to RStudio's default theme, Textmate. Or, you can use `rsthemes::use_default_rstudio_theme()` to initiate the switch, perhaps from within the `.Rprofile` file of your teaching project.
